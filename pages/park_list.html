National parks in India are IUCN category II protected areas. India's first national park was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park , now known as Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand. By 1970, India only had five national parks. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger in 1973 to safeguard the habitats of conservation reliant species.<br><br>

Further federal legislation strengthening protection for wildlife was introduced in the 1980s.<br><br>

There are 106 existing national parks in India covering an area of 43,716 km2, which is 1.33% of the geographical area of the country (National Wildlife Database, Dec. 2020). In addition to the above, 75 other National Parks covering an area of 16,608 km2 are proposed in the Protected Area Network Report (Rodgers & Panwar, 1988).  The network of parks will go up 176 after full implementation of the above report.

A national park is a natural park in use for conservation purposes, created and protected by national governments. Often it is a reserve of natural,
 semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently
, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride.

The United States established the first "public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people", Yellowstone National Park,
 in 1872. Although Yellowstone was not officially termed a "national park" in its establishing law, it was always termed such in practice and is widely
 held to be the first and oldest national park in the world. However, the Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve (established in 1776),and the area surroundin
 Bogd Khan Uul Mountain (1778), which were restricted from cultivation in order to protect surrounding farmland, are seen as the oldest legally protected areas.

An international organization, the <spam>International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)</span>, and its World Commission on Protected Areas
 (WCPA), has defined "National Park" as its Category II type of protected areas. According to the IUCN, 6,555 national parks worldwide met its criteria 
in 2006. IUCN is still discussing the parameters of defining a national park.

The world's first national park service was established May 19, 1911, in Canada.
The Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act placed the dominion parks under the 
administration of the Dominion Park Branch (now Parks Canada), within the Department
 of the Interior. The branch was established to "protect sites of natural wonder" to provide 
a recreational experience, centred on the idea of the natural world providing rest and spiritual renewal from 
the urban setting.Canada now has the largest protected area in the world with 450,000 km2 of national park space.

Even with the creation of Yellowstone, Yosemite, and nearly 37 other national parks and monuments, another 44 years passed before an agency was created in the United States to administer these units in a comprehensive way – the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The 64th United States Congress passed the National Park Service Organic Act, which President Woodrow Wilson signed into law on 25 August 1916. Of the 423 sites managed by the National Park Service of the United States, only 63 carry the designation of National Park.[42] <br>

<p align = "left"><font size = "4" face = "Footlight MT	"><b>Peacocks are commonly found in dry areas. Peacocks are also found in forest areas. The male peacock has enormous tail feathers that
fan out behind the peacock and can be nearly two meters in length. The male peacock attracts a female to mate with by showing off his array of elaborate feathers, and when the male peacock feels
threatened, he will fan his tail out in order to make himself look bigger and therefore try to intimidate approaching predators. Indian peacocks found inhabiting the undergrowth in open forest, shrubs and woodland, usually near a river or stream. The Indian peacocks are also found in farmland, villages and increasingly more urban areas.
<br> <br>  The peacock is an omnivorous bird and feeds on insects, plants, seeds, small mammals, reptiles and flowers. Male peacocks are known as mor and female peacocks are known as morni. The male peacock is generally about twice the size of the female peacock and even larger when the male peacock is displaying his feathers. The nest is made up of dry sticks, fodder, grass and leaves and is located on the ground, under shrubs. Breeding season between April to September. Indian peacock prefer a mostly solitary and isolated lifestyle. During the breeding season, a male will defend its territory and females will seek them out as mates. After and before of the breeding season, females live alone or with other females in groups of 2 or 4 and males also can live alone or with other males in groups.
<br> <br>Age of sexual maturity is 2 years for male and 3 years female peacock. There is a significant correlation between a peacocks train and it�s mating success. Mating success is usually more successful for the males with the highest number of ocelli on their train. If ocelli were experimentally removed from a male�s train, mating success decreased significantly. Male peacocks are very aggressive when it comes to finding a suitable partner and stronger females will fight away other females and try to monopolize the male by repeatedly mating with him. On average, males usually mate with up to 4-7 different females every breeding season. The female peacock lays 4-7 eggs. The color of eggs is brown. The female peacock incubates eggs and the male peacock chicks hatch after an incubation period of about a month. The incubation period of eggs is between 26 to 30 days.

Carl Linnaeus in his work Systema Naturae in 1758 assigned to the Indian peafowl the technical name of Pavo cristatus (means "crested peafowl" in classical Latin).

The earliest usage of the word in written English is from around 1300 and spelling variants include pecok, pekok, pecokk, peacocke, peocock, pyckock, poucock, pocok, pokok, pokokke, and poocok among others. The current spelling was established in the late 17th century. Chaucer (1343�1400) used the word to refer to a proud and ostentatious person in his simile "proud a pekok" in Troilus and Criseyde (Book I, line 210).

The Greek word for peacock was taos and was related to the Persian "tavus" (as in Takht-i-T�vus for the famed Peacock Throne. The Ancient Hebrew word tuki (plural tukkiyim) has been said to have been derived from the Tamil tokei but sometimes traced to the Egyptian tekh.In modern Hebrew the word for peacock is "tavas". In Sanskrit, the peacock is known as Mayura and is associated with the killing of snakes.

Peacocks are a larger sized bird with a length from bill to tail of 100 to 115 cm (39 to 45 in) and to the end of a fully grown train as much as 195 to 225 cm (77 to 89 in) and weigh 4�6 kg (8.8�13.2 lb). The females, or peahens, are smaller at around 95 cm (37 in) in length and weigh 2.75�4 kg (6.1�8.8 lb). Indian peafowl are among the largest and heaviest representatives of the Phasianidae. So far as is known, only the wild turkey grows notably heavier. The green peafowl is slightly lighter in body mass despite the male having a longer train on average than the male of the Indian species. Their size, colour and shape of crest make them unmistakable within their native distribution range. The male is metallic blue on the crown, the feathers of the head being short and curled. The fan-shaped crest on the head is made of feathers with bare black shafts and tipped with bluish-green webbing. A white stripe above the eye and a crescent shaped white patch below the eye are formed by bare white skin. The sides of the head have iridescent greenish blue feathers. The back has scaly bronze-green feathers with black and copper markings. The scapular and the wings are buff and barred in black, the primaries are chestnut and the secondaries are black. The tail is dark brown and the "train" is made up of elongated upper tail coverts (more than 200 feathers, the actual tail has only 20 feathers) and nearly all of these feathers end with an elaborate eye-spot. A few of the outer feathers lack the spot and end in a crescent shaped black tip. The underside is dark glossy green shading into blackish under the tail. The thighs are buff coloured. The male has a spur on the leg above the hind toe.

Call of Pavo cristatus
The adult peahen has a rufous-brown head with a crest as in the male but the tips are chestnut edged with green. The upper body is brownish with pale mottling. The primaries, secondaries and tail are dark brown. The lower neck is metallic green and the breast feathers are dark brown glossed with green. The remaining underparts are whitish. Downy young are pale buff with a dark brown mark on the nape that connects with the eyes. Young males look like the females but the wings are chestnut coloured.[8][9]

The most common calls are a loud pia-ow or may-awe. The frequency of calling increases before the Monsoon season and may be delivered in alarm or when disturbed by loud noises. In forests, their calls often indicate the presence of a predators such as the tiger.[6][9] They also make many other calls such as a rapid series of ka-aan..ka-aan or a rapid kok-kok. They often emit an explosive low-pitched honk! when agitated.

Peafowl are best known for the male's extravagant display feathers which, despite actually growing from their back, are thought of as a tail. The "train" is in reality made up of the enormously elongated upper tail coverts. The tail itself is brown and short as in the peahen. The colours result not from any green or blue pigments but from the micro-structure of the feathers and the resulting optical phenomena.[23] The long train feathers (and tarsal spurs) of the male develop only after the second year of life. Fully developed trains are found in birds older than four years. In northern India, these begin to develop each February and are moulted at the end of August.[24] The moult of the flight feathers may be spread out across the year.[25]

Peafowl forage on the ground in small groups, known as musters, that usually have a cock and 3 to 5 hens. After the breeding season, the flocks tend to be made up only of females and young. They are found in the open early in the mornings and tend to stay in cover during the heat of the day. They are fond of dust-bathing and at dusk, groups walk in single file to a favourite waterhole to drink. When disturbed, they usually escape by running and rarely take to flight.[9]

Peafowl produce loud calls especially in the breeding season. They may call at night when alarmed and neighbouring birds may call in a relay like series. Nearly seven different call variants have been identified in the peacocks apart from six alarm calls that are commonly produced by both sexes.[26]

Peafowl roost in groups during the night on tall trees but may sometimes make use of rocks, buildings or pylons. In the Gir forest, they chose tall trees in steep river banks.[27][28] Birds arrive at dusk and call frequently before taking their position on the roost trees.[29] Due to this habit of congregating at the roost, many population studies are made at these sites. The population structure is not well understood. In a study in northern India (Jodhpur), the number of males was 170�210 for 100 females but a study involving evening counts at the roost site in southern India (Injar) suggested a ratio of 47 males for 100 females.
